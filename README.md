# RNHW

You took the role to develop a React Native app which has the following REQUIRED features:

- Show a list of countries

<img src="problem/1.png" width="300" />

- When user taps on a country, show country screen

<img src="problem/2.png" width="300" />

- When user taps on a continent, show continent screen with a list of countries of the continent

<img src="problem/3.png" width="300" />

- App should have a floating button throughout screens to switch between light and dark mode.
- When user taps on a country on the continent screen, show the country screen again
- When user visits [rnhw://country/:code](rnhw://country/:code), show country screen
- When user visits [rnhw://continent/:code](rnhw://continent/:code), show continent screen.

There are some expectation you should be known:

- Deeplinks should work well in killed state and background state
- You should use state management in your project for neccessary state
- You should use typescript
- App should have the best performance and handle all the errors
- Your code should be clean, we will look them carefully
